# pa-pres-election-swing
As a part of a Data Visualization class (36-613) I took during my master's program at Carnegie Mellon University, I created an infographic that, initially, started as a surface-level analysis of party swing in Pennsylvania in recent U.S. presidential elections. It later developed into a set of visualizations that narrated the story surrounding the breaking of the [["Blue Wall"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wall_(U.S._politics))] in Pennsylvania during the 2016 election. As a swing state with the highest electoral vote count, Pennsylvania is often discussed.

The data I used to make this infographic comes from the Harvard Dataverse's County Presidential [Election Returns 2000-2020 dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ). 

In the advent of the 2024 election, I aim to pull more data and extend the current visualization. 

I would love to hear any feedback or questions you may have for me! Please feel free to reach out to me at atshih@andrew.cmu.edu or andrewtshih@berkeley.edu.
