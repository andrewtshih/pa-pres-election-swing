# pa-pres-election-swing
As a part of a Data Visualization class (36-613) I took during my master's program at Carnegie Mellon University, I created an infographic that, initially, started as a surface-level analysis of party swing in Pennsylvania in recent U.S. presidential elections. It later developed into a set of visualizations that narrated the story surrounding the breaking of the ["Blue Wall"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wall_(U.S._politics)) in Pennsylvania during the 2016 election. As a swing state with the highest electoral vote count, Pennsylvania is often discussed.

The data I used to make this infographic comes from the Harvard Dataverse's County Presidential [Election Returns 2000-2020 dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ). 

In the advent of the 2024 election, I aim to pull more data and extend the current visualization. Please find the infographic in its current state in the file titled "infographic_project_final.pdf" under the "pa_elections_1.0" directory.

**Edit 2/24/25:** Hi! It's been a few months since the 2024 election, and all the votes have been counted. I performed some analyses pulling some [county-level election data from Tom McGovern (tonmcg)](https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-24/blob/master/2024_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results.csv) on GitHub, which he scrapped from Fox News. I uncovered some new insights that you can see in more detail in the file titled "2024_pa_election_infographic.pdf" under the "pa_elections_24" directory.

I would love to hear any feedback or questions you may have for me! Please feel free to reach out to me at atshih@andrew.cmu.edu or andrewtshih@berkeley.edu.
